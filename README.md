# Dream-Village

This is a opengl project which is implemented using C++.

This project is based on a dream scenario of a village. The Basic structure of the scene contains a river on the right hand of the scene which consists of many boats floating around. On the top of the scene we have a sky full of moving clouds and birds and a sun. Down below we have many houses arranged in a specific order and thus make up a dream scene. In this project there will be three modes: Day, Night & Rainy. Weâ€™ll be able to control all the modes with keyboard inputs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day Mode: There will be clouds, birds and the sun in the sky. The whole scenario would be sunny.

Night Mode: This mode will contain the moon on the sky instead of sun and no clouds. Whole scenario would be dark. Boat in the river will have lights, so they can be visible.

Rainy Mode: There will be loads of rain dropping from sky. Rain will be dropping on the river and village houses, thus all together will make a remarkable scenario.
